""" 

This portion exists to isolate the quantsim objects from the numpy calculations. this script will accept any form of quantsim, and will run a simulation based on the predefined object properties of the quantsim.

This is where experimental parameters are important, the user will define for what values of x and t should the simulation run over, what the dx and dt values will be, and overall control everything that is related to the calculation of the problems.
