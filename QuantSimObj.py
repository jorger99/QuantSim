"""
A 'Quantsim' is an object created from the QuantumSimulationObject class defined in the QuantSimObj.py file. This function has its own .py file in order to isolate and define the quantum objects prior to being experimented on.

Important QuantSim features:

- wavefunction $(\Psi)$ definition [assumed potential]
    - harmonic modes [sq. well]  
    - tunneling particle [V = 0]
    - non-normalized free particle [V != $\inf$]
    - wave packet free particle [V != $\inf$]


- experimental parameters
    - [sq well] how many modes to show, if any
    - [sq well] potential well, depth
    - [tunneling particle] potential barrier height, thickness
    - [free particle] use wavepacket or not
 
 
- simulation values: 
    - m, q, k, E, $\omega$
